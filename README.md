# üöÄ #100DaysOfCode Challenge - Full Stack Web Development
I‚Äôm back and ready to code! Let‚Äôs start coding! üíª This repository documents my #100DaysOfCode challenge, where I'll be coding every day to master full-stack web development. Follow along as I work with frontend and backend technologies to build real-world projects and level up my skills!

## üåü Objective

The primary goal of this challenge is to build a strong foundation in both frontend and backend web development while working on real-world projects. The technologies I'm focusing on include:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and responsive design principles.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, and RESTful APIs.
- **Database**: MongoDB, SQL, and Firebase.
- **DevOps & Tools**: Git, GitHub, Docker, and CI/CD workflows.
- **Other Technologies**: Authentication, Cloud services, and deployment platforms like Heroku, AWS, and Netlify.
